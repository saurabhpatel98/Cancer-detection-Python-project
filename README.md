# CANCER DETECTION

I have used various machine learning algorithm to predict the type of cancer(Malignant and Benign) in Patients. I have compared the results of neural network and Decision tree algorithm with the logistic regression algorithm.

Here, Mr. John Hughes suggested that a neural network is the best choice to detect the cancer.

### Data source - Kaggle

### SUMMARY OF KEY FINDINGS 

1. Key Statistics </br>
2. Implemented and evaluated different algorithms </br>
3. compared the results of final NN algo to the Logistic regression algo with below given output </br>

### ASSUMPTIONS FOR NN(NEURAL NETWORK)

1. Used 20% for the test size, i.e test_size = 0.2 </br>
2. Hidden_layer_size = (9,4,2) </br>
3. max_iter = 10000 </br>
4. random_state = 100 </br>
